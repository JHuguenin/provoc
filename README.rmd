The `icons` package for R makes adding web icons to reports, presentations and apps easy. It integrates many popular icon libraries from around the web with a simple interface that works with any `rmarkdown` output format. If a particular icon library is not explicitly supported by this package, you can still use it by creating a custom icon set from a folder of SVG files. Icons provide flexible means of digital expression, allowing expressions and functionality beyond what is possible with emoji.

The `icons` package currently provides helpful tools for downloading and using icons from these libraries:

* [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/) (Pro icons can be used using custom icon sets)
* [Ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons/)
* [Academicons](https://github.com/jpswalsh/academicons)
* [Simple Icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/)
* [Google's Material Design](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)
* [Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons)
* [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather)
* [Bioicons](https://github.com/duerrsimon/bioicons)

# Installation

The **development** version can be installed from GitHub using:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jhuguenin/provoc")
```

Once you've installed the package you'll also need to download some icons! Supported icon libraries (listed above) can be downloaded using the `download_*()` functions. For example, to download the Font Awesome icons you would use `download_fontawesome()`.

# Usage

```{r load}
library(provoc)
```

Icons can be inserted inline using inline code `` `r knitr::inline_expr('icons::fontawesome("rocket", style = "solid")')` `` `r icons::fontawesome("rocket", style = "solid")` or `` `r knitr::inline_expr('icons::fontawesome$solid$rocket')` `` `r icons::fontawesome$solid$rocket`.

Icons can also be inserted using usual R chunks.
